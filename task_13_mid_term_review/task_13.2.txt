a. An RDD is a Resilient Distributed Dataset. This is a read only collection of data that is divided into partitions that can be distributed amongst worker nodes.

b. A DAG is a Directed Acyclic Graph where, in spark terms, the vertices are operations and the corners are RDDs. This keeps track of the operations to be applied to the data.

c. The spark driver is the node which declares operations to be carried out and submits them to the master node for distribution amonst the workers.

d. Spark is fault tolerant and achieves this by recalculating lost or corrupted data from rdds that still exist instead of calculting from scratch.
