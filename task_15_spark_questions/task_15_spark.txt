1. Local runs the spark script locally. Local[*] runs the scripts with as many threads as there are logical cores on the local machine.

2. Map applies a function of every element in an iterable. Flatmap “flattens” the iterable first by making each item into a top level element. For example (“a”,(”b”,”c”)) is computed as if it were (“a”,”b”,”c”)

3.  You can reference data in an external storage system or apply transformations on an existing RDD.

4. map operates on every full item in the iterable. mapValues operates on only the values in a key-value pair.

5. reduceByKey().
